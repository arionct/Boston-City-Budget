# City of Boston: City Budget

## Description
The City of Boston's budget includes an **operating budget** and a **capital budget**. The operating budget handles day-to-day expenses including public employees and services. On the other hand, the capital budget is more focused on improving currently owned assets. To optimize the allocation of resources for these budgets, it is crucial to understand how Boston's money is being spent. Through collaboration with the Citywide Analytics Team, Boston's central data organization, this project aims to analyze how Boston spends its annual budget and any changes over time. Further, this project will contrast the projected spending against the actual spending and also examine per capita spending.

## Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the City of Boston's allocation of resources through the analysis of documented data. This project seeks to achieve this by:
# Observing the spending's change over time to isolate any trends
# Identifying differences in projected spending and actual spending
# Exploring per capita spending
# Investigating spending by department, budget category, geography, and program
